# DataDisk Project
I've always liked Tron the first one i watched was Tron:Legacy, then i went back and watched the original and i loved both. since then ive been a big fan of Tron and ive wanted to make my own datadisk for years but the tech was never able to do what i wanted or it was way too expensive. But, after many years the tech has caught up and the prices have somewhat fallen and i think now is a good time to make it so, here are my plans for the datadisk.
